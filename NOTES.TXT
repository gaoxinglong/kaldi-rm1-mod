Word pair -> Grammar(G) WFST conversion (scripts/make_rm_lm.pl)
---------------------------------------------------------------

The probability mass is distributed equally among all successor words in a pair.
The weights are in negative natural logarithms of the probability. For example
if there are N successor words for word X, the state in the WFST that represents
X(lets call this Sx) will have N output arcs with input and output labels equal
to the successor word and weight -log(1/N).
The start state has ID of 0 and has arcs to all words that can legitimately start
a sentence. According to the rules described in 'wp_gram.txt' these are signified
by making them successors of the special 'SENTENCE-END' token.
The words that can be placed last in a sentence(have 'SENTENCE-END' as a successor)
have arcs with epsilon input/output labels(and weight as normal) to the unique end 
state.
